# RPN-Calculator
This program performs Reverse Polish Notation

Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands.

It allows you to do macros, these macros can be user written by having the user posting a command on each line or they record it in real time and save it to that file. To do this just click the Rec option. Afterwards, perform the tasks you wish to be in a macro. After you are ready just select save and the macroFile.txt will be created.



Save that as MacroFile.txt

# How To Use

If you are running from the command line use **java -jar "RPNCalculator.jar"**

If you have JRE installed you can double click **RPNCalculator.jar**
